# Use Case 01: Marketing Customer Segmentation with Explainable Signals

## Why this matters
Marketing teams move fast, but customer segmentation often falls behind real behavior. Segments get built once, trusted for too long, and then quietly stop making sense. When teams cannot explain why someone belongs to a segment, trust breaks down and decisions stall.

An explainable approach keeps segmentation useful, current, and something teams actually want to use.

## Who it helps
Primary users: Marketing and growth teams  
Secondary users: Sales, analytics, customer support  
Indirect impact: Customers receiving messages, offers, and recommendations

## Where it fits
- Customer data is reviewed on a regular cadence
- Segment suggestions are generated with clear reasoning
- Teams review and adjust before campaigns go live
- Campaigns run by segment
- Performance and drift are monitored over time

## Data needed
- Data sources: CRM, web behavior, purchase history, engagement data
- Key inputs: recency, frequency, spend, category interest
- Data quality considerations: missing profiles, inconsistent identifiers
- Privacy notes: consent, retention, and usage boundaries

## Possible approaches
Option A: Simple rules that teams can easily understand and challenge  
Option B: Clustering with plain language explanations  
Option C: Hybrid where AI suggests and humans decide

## Trust and guardrails
- What could go wrong: short term trends overpowering long term behavior, hidden bias
- Where human judgment is required: naming segments and deciding activation
- What should be logged or reviewed: segment stability, campaign lift, and drift
- What should never be automated: sensitive targeting decisions without review

## Adoption reality check
- Teams need clarity, not model internals
- Starting with a small pilot builds confidence
- Regular reviews prevent blind reliance

## What success looks like
- Stronger campaign performance by segment
- Faster setup with less manual work
- Fewer targeting mistakes
- Teams choosing to reuse the approach
