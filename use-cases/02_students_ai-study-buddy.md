# Use Case 02: Student AI Study Buddy with Learning Guardrails

## Why this matters
Students are already using AI, whether institutions plan for it or not. The real question is whether AI supports learning or quietly replaces it. A study buddy designed with guardrails helps students think better, practice more effectively, and build confidence without turning AI into a shortcut machine.

This use case focuses on supporting understanding, not skipping effort.

## Who it helps
Primary users: Students across high school, college, and continuing education  
Secondary users: Educators, tutors, academic support teams  
Indirect impact: Institutions responsible for learning outcomes and integrity

## Where it fits
- Students review concepts before or after class
- AI helps explain topics in different ways
- Practice questions are generated for self-checks
- Students reflect on answers before seeing guidance
- Progress and gaps are tracked over time

## Data needed
- Data sources: Course materials, syllabi, practice content
- Key inputs: Topics, learning objectives, difficulty level
- Data quality considerations: outdated materials, inconsistent formatting
- Privacy notes: minimal personal data, strong boundaries for student inputs

## Possible approaches
Option A: Retrieval-based explanations grounded in approved materials  
Option B: Guided questioning that nudges students toward answers  
Option C: Hybrid where AI supports practice and reflection, not final answers

## Trust and guardrails
- What could go wrong: over-reliance on AI, surface-level understanding
- Where human judgment is required: grading, assessment, academic decisions
- What should be logged or reviewed: usage patterns and learning progress
- What should never be automated: completing graded assignments on behalf of students

## Adoption reality check
- Students need clarity on what the tool is and is not
- Educators need visibility into how it supports learning
- Clear norms prevent misuse and confusion

## What success looks like
- Improved confidence and concept retention
- More practice without increased grading load
- Reduced temptation to misuse AI
- Students choosing to use the tool as support, not replacement
