# AI Use Cases Portfolio

This repository brings together practical AI use cases across work, learning, and everyday problem solving.

The focus here is not flashy demos or theoretical ideas. It is about showing how AI can be designed, evaluated, and adopted in ways that actually make sense for people.

You will see examples that span business teams, students, early-career learners, and small organizations. Different contexts, same core question. How do we use AI responsibly and well?

If you are short on time, start here.

### Featured use cases
- Marketing: Customer segmentation with explainable signals  
  `/use-cases/01_marketing_customer-segmentation.md`

- Students: AI study buddy that supports learning, not shortcuts  
  `/use-cases/02_students_ai-study-buddy.md`

Each use case walks through the problem, the data, the approach options, the trust considerations, and what adoption really looks like.

## What this portfolio is about

Across all use cases, you will see a consistent lens:
- Clear problem framing
- Practical workflows
- Multiple solution paths, not one “right” answer
- Guardrails, trust, and human judgment
- Adoption that considers real behavior, not ideal behavior

The goal is to make AI feel usable, grounded, and worth trusting.
