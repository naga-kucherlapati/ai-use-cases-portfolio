# AI Use Cases Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of AI use cases designed for real-world application across industries, functions, and career stages.

The intent here is not to showcase flashy demos. It is to document how AI can be thoughtfully designed, evaluated, and adopted in everyday workflows. This includes enterprise teams, students, early-career professionals, and small business owners.

Each use case reflects how decisions are made in practice. That means starting with the problem, understanding context, assessing data readiness, and thinking through trust, risk, and adoption from day one.

## How this portfolio is organized

Each use case walks through:
- The problem being solved and why it matters
- Who it helps, whether teams, individuals, learners, or customers
- Where it fits in a real workflow
- Data required and quality considerations
- Possible approaches, including rules, retrieval, ML, agents, or hybrids
- Risks, guardrails, and trust signals
- Adoption considerations such as enablement, change, and usage
- Success metrics beyond model accuracy

The emphasis is on clarity, responsibility, and usability.

## Notes

This is a living portfolio.
Use cases will evolve over time through templates, diagrams, lightweight experiments, and reflections on what worked, what did not, and why.

The goal is to make AI feel approachable, grounded, and genuinely useful, regardless of role or background.
