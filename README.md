# AI Use Cases Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of AI use cases designed for real-world application across industries, functions, and career stages.

The goal is not to showcase flashy demos, but to document how AI can be thoughtfully designed, evaluated, and adopted across business workflows — from enterprise teams to students, early-career learners, and small business owners.

Each use case is structured to reflect practical decision-making: problem framing, data readiness, trust considerations, and adoption in context.

## How this portfolio is organized

Each use case includes:
- The problem being solved and why it matters
- Who it helps (teams, individuals, learners, or customers)
- Where it fits in a real workflow
- Data required and quality considerations
- Approach options (rules, retrieval, ML, agents, or hybrids)
- Risks, trust signals, and guardrails
- Adoption considerations (change, enablement, usage)
- Success metrics beyond just accuracy

The emphasis is on **clarity, responsibility, and usability**, not complexity.

## Notes

This is a living portfolio.
Use cases will evolve over time with templates, diagrams, lightweight experiments, and reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and why.

The intent is to make AI feel **approachable, grounded, and useful** — regardless of role or background.
