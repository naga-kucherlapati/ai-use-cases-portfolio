# Use Cases

This section brings AI use cases to life across work, learning, and everyday problem solving.

These are not hypothetical ideas. Each use case is written to reflect how AI is actually explored, evaluated, and adopted across teams, functions, and individual contexts.

The goal is simple. Make AI feel useful, understandable, and grounded in reality.

## What each use case covers

Every use case walks through:
- The problem and why it is worth solving
- Who it helps and who it impacts
- Where it fits in a real workflow
- The data it depends on
- Different ways the solution could be approached
- Trust, risk, and human judgment points
- What adoption actually looks like
- How success should be measured
